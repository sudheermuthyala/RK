## She-Bang
- #! is called as She-Bang
- It denotes the path of the interpreter and ensures the remaining lines are executed using that interpreter.
- For a file only one She-Bang is possible.
- Also She-Bang has to be in very first line
- If script executes as <shell> <script> then mentioned shell will be used
- If the script is executed as ./script then she-bang is used.
- If the script is executed as ./script but she-bang is not there then default shell bash is used
